### What i learnt while building this project
I built this project while i was just getting introduced to APIs so i kind of got confused on how to handle & output the data i was consuming from the API , 
I was given a boring template so i had to redesign it to my taste , other things i learnt :
- API Endpoints
- Creating Modal Popups
- fetch API
- In-depth knowledge of Javascript
